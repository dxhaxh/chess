This is a self made, fully functioning(yes you can castle, yes there is en passant, yes castling through checks has been restricted as per regular chess rules, yes a player cannot put themselves in check and must stop a check if they are in check as per regular chess rules) chess game that can be played with two players. When the game ends, the result is printed on the console and there are no more possible moves since the game is over.
